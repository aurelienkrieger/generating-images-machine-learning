# Seed

During the first step of a Text to Image process, Stable Diffusion generates a random tensor in the latent space. You control this tensor by setting the seed of the random number generator. If you set the seed to a certain value, you will always get the same random tensor.

## Reproducibility

If you use the same seed with the same prompt, model and parameters, you will get the exact same image, so it can be used to ensaure the reproducibility.

## Exploration

Setting a random seed will generate a new random image for each batch, so it can be used for exploration.

## Interpolation

AUTOMATIC1111 offer the option to control the degree of interpolation to produce a transition between the images genearted by two seeds. See [Andrew Wong, 2023, "Stable Diffusion WebUI AUTOMATIC1111: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide"](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/automatic1111/#Extra_seed_options) for more details.
