<h3 id="neuromancer-by-william-gibson"><em>Neuromancer</em> by William Gibson</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotwired to the leading edges of art and technology, Neuromancer is a cyberpunk, science fiction masterpiece‚Äîa classic that ranks with 1984 and Brave New World as one of the twentieth century‚Äôs most potent visions of the future.</p>
<p>Henry Dorsett Case was the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employees crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.</p>

<h3 id="leo-africanus-by-amin-maalouf"><em>Leo Africanus</em> by Amin Maalouf</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I, Hasan the son of Muhammad the weigh-master, I, Jean-Leon de Medici, circumcised at the hand of a barber and baptized at the hand of a pope, I am now called the African, but I am not from Africa, nor from Europe, nor from Arabia. I am also called the Granadan, the Fassi, the Zayyati, but I come from no country, from no city, no tribe. I am the son of the road, my country is the caravan, my life the most unexpected of voyages.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus wrote Leo Africanus, in his fortieth year, in this imaginary autobiography of the famous geographer, adventurer, and scholar Hasan al-Wazzan, who was born in Granada in 1488. His family fled the Inquisition and took him to the city of Fez, in North Africa. Hasan became an itinerant merchant, and made many journeys to the East, journeys rich in adventure and observation. He was captured by a Sicilian pirate and taken back to Rome as a gift to Pope Leo X, who baptized him Johannes Leo. While in Rome, he wrote the first trilingual dictionary (Latin, Arabic and Hebrew), as well as his celebrated Description of Africa , for which he is still remembered as Leo Africanus.</p>

<h3 id="just-kids-by-patti-smith"><em>Just Kids</em> by Patti Smith</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1967, a chance meeting between two young people led to a romance and a lifelong friendship that would carry each to international success never dreamed of. The backdrop is Brooklyn, Chelsea Hotel, Max&apos;s Kansas City, Scribner&apos;s Bookstore, Coney Island, Warhol&apos;s Factory and the whole city resplendent. Among their friends, literary lights, musicians and artists such as Harry Smith, Bobby Neuwirth, Allen Ginsberg, Sandy Daley, Sam Shepherd, William Burroughs, etc. It was a heightened time politically and culturally; the art and music worlds exploding and colliding. In the midst of all this two kids made a pact to always care for one another. Scrappy, romantic, committed to making art, they prodded and provided each other with faith and confidence during the hungry years--the days of cous-cous and lettuce soup.</p>
<p>Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. Beautifully written, this is a profound portrait of two young artists, often hungry, sated only by art and experience. And an unforgettable portrait of New York, her rich and poor, hustlers and hellions, those who made it and those whose memory lingers near.</p>

<h2 id="the-frolic-of-the-beasts-by-yukio-mishima"><em>The Frolic of the Beasts</em> by Yukio Mishima</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Translated into English for the first time, a gripping short novel about an affair gone wrong, from the author of the Sea of Fertility tetralogy.</p>
<p>Set in rural Japan shortly after World War II, The Frolic of the Beasts tells the story of a strange and utterly absorbing love triangle between a former university student, K≈çji; his would-be mentor, the eminent literary critic Ippei Kusakudo; and Ippei‚Äôs beautiful, enigmatic wife, Y≈´ko. When brought face-to-face with one of Ippei‚Äôs many marital indiscretions, K≈çji finds his growing desire for Y≈´ko compels him to action in a way that changes all three of their lives profoundly. Originally published in 1961 and now available in English for the first time, The Frolic of the Beasts is a haunting examination of the various guises we assume throughout our lives, and a tale of psychological self-entrapment, seduction, and crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-road-by-cormac-mccarthy"><em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs masterpiece.</p>
<p>A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don‚Äôt know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food‚Äîand each other.</p>
<p>The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, ‚Äúeach the other‚Äôs world entire,‚Äù are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-joy-luck-club-by-amy-tan"><em>The Joy Luck Club</em> by Amy Tan</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Four mothers, four daughters, four families, whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who&apos;s telling the stories. In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters&apos; futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers&apos; advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives ‚Äì until their own inner crises reveal how much they&apos;ve unknowingly inherited of their mothers&apos; pasts.</p>
<p>With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.</p>
