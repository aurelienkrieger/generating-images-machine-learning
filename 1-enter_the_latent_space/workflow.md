- Prompt engineering: Learn how to write prompts that can be interpreted by the SD model to generate an image with the desired subject and style.
- Generative models: We can use a variety of base models to achive specific styles or represent specific concepts with more accuracy.
- Additional models: We can use other models to complement the base model and achieve a higher level of control over the general composition and style.
- GUI: Graphical User Interface, the end-user application we will use to manage models and prompts and run the scripts to generate the images. The central piece of our creative workflow.
