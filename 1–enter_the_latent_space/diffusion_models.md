# Diffusion Models

During this course we will be focusing on Stable Diffusion (SD) to create generative art. Stable Diffusion belongs to a class of deep learning models called diffusion models. They are generative models, meaning they are designed to generate new data similar to what they have seen in training. In the case of Stable Diffusion, the data are images.

## State of the Art

Below is an illustration of the state of art of Machine Learning models, in 4 catogories: Datasets, Classifiers, Generative Models and End-User Applications.

## Workflow

This diagram provides with an overview of the topics we will be discussing during the course that reflects the workflow for generative AI art.

- Prompt engineering: Learn how to write prompts that can be interpreted by the SD model to generate an image with the desired subject and style.
- Generative models: We can use a variety of base models to achive specific styles or represent specific concepts with more accuracy.
- Additional models: We can use other models to complement the base model and achieve a higher level of control over the general composition and style.
- GUI: Graphical User Interface, the end-user application we will use to manage models and prompts and run the scripts to generate the images. The central piece of our creative workflow.
