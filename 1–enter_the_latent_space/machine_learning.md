# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on those patterns without being explicitly told how to do so.
