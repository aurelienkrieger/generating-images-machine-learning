# Composite Memory

## Objective

Use generative AI to visualize a memory that tells an aspect of your own story.

## Description

Our memories are much more malleable than we think. Each time we recall a memory, we alter certain details of it, re-remembering them in their new, altered form. As this process is repeated over time, we come to no longer know what is memory and what is imagination. In fact, scientists have shown that the same cerebral process is at work when we recall a memory and when we imagine a new concept or formulate a new idea. Also, oftentimes when we describe our memories to our friends, our spoken words construct an image in their mind. This image is an interpretation of our memories and inevitably will look very different from the image in our mind.

This project explores the ambiguity in human language as well as the friction between human memory and AI (re-)interpretation. This is the opportunity to explore how you can implement the AI tools into your creative workflow and how this influences your work.

The depiction of your memory does not need to be an exact representation. In fact, this will likely be impossible. The end result will be a combination of how you can recall your memory, your interpretation of that memory and how you are able to render it with AI. Try to use the inpredictable nature of AI as an opportunity to reinterpret your memory through happy accidents, glitches to emphasis the co-creative process.

It is up to you in terms of how you want to approach this project conceptually. You may take it literally and visualize a specific event of your life, or recall the memory of a memory that a family member told you in the past, or even a myth, a traditional story that have been shared throughout generations and to which you relate to.

## Requirements

- you must use a combinaison of AI tools (text to image, image to image, inpainting, ...) with traditional tools (drawing, photography, photo-collage, poetry ...)
- you need to reflect on and document the workflow you used to create your memory visualisation on the Miro board: which models, prompts, tools you used step by step, so that you can share it at the end of the course and allow the rest of the group to benefit from your findings

## Submission

This is an ongoing project. You will all be invited to share your image & workflow during the last session of the course.

## Learning objectives

- experiment with ways to integrate AI tools into your creative workflow
- refine your images as we continue learning about new techniques
- reflect on this hybrid workflow and share insights with peers
