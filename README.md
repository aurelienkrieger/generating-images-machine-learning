# Generating Images with Machine Learning
Learn how to use generative AI models for concept art & design

## Course description

During this course we‚Äôll explore how text-to-images generative models help define new visual languages but also how they alter our perception of reality as a society. As a group, we will explore how artists can use IA in a co-creation process by making its core concepts & techniques more explicit. We will also take a critical look at Machine Learning from the inside and discuss its ethical dilemmas with real-world examples. Participants can expect to be equipped with creative and critical tools that allow them to develop their own projects and create alternative, inclusive visual narratives.

## Learning Outcomes

- Learn about prompt engineering for generative imagery
- Apply advanced techniques for visual compositing
- Explore various models and learn how to train your own
- Discuss ethical dilemmas and develop critical thinking on the field
